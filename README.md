## Key Insights

### Q1: What are the factors that significantly affect the total price of lands, apartments, and villas?
- **Lands**: The total price is primarily influenced by the price per square meter, with a moderate correlation to total area.
- **Villas**: Features like swimming pools, driverâ€™s rooms, and elevators have a significant impact on pricing.
- **Apartments**: The number of rooms and bathrooms are key factors affecting the price.

### Q2: What type of land is most common in Riyadh?
- Residential lands are the most dominant category in Riyadh, followed by mixed-use and commercial lands. This indicates a strong demand for residential properties over commercial investments.

### Q3: Is there a relationship between space and price, with distinction in the number of rooms?
- There is a positive correlation between space and total price, though the relationship is not strictly linear.
- The number of rooms also plays a role, with more rooms generally increasing the price.
- Some properties with similar space show significant price variations due to additional amenities and location factors.

### Q4: Which neighborhoods have the most apartments?
- Al-Narjis and Al-Malqa have the highest number of apartments, making them prime residential locations.
- Other areas like Al-Arid and Al-Yasmeen also show high concentrations of apartments.
- Neighborhoods such as Al-Murooj, Al-Aqiq, and Al-Nafil have the least number of apartments, indicating lower-density developments.

### Additional Insights

1. **Distribution of apartments by neighborhood**: Al-Narjis and Al-Malqa have the largest share of apartments, indicating high demand in these areas.
2. **Relationship between space and price with room count distinction**: More spacious properties tend to have higher prices, but the number of rooms also plays a significant role.
3. **Price distribution by number of rooms**: The price varies significantly based on the number of rooms, with noticeable outliers in certain categories.
4. **Regional distribution of properties**: The highest concentration of properties is in the western and eastern parts of Riyadh, while the central area has the least availability.
5. **Most common property orientations**: North-facing properties are the most common, followed by east and west orientations, reflecting market preferences.
